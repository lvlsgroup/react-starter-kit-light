## Setup
### DEVELOPMENT
1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev`
### PRODUCTION
1. `npm i`
2. `npm run buildscript`
2. `npm run prod`

## Feature Branches
I will add specific features in other branches and create an PR for them (but it should never be merged) so it is easy to see the new code.
1. User:
    1. TAGS: (login, auth cookie, redirect after successful login, cookie banner)
    2. CODE: https://github.com/lvlsgroup/react-starter-kit/pull/1

## EDITORS
#### WEBSTORM SETUP
0. Make sure you have done `npm i`
0. eslint/prettier:
    - Go to: Preferences | Languages & Frameworks | JavaScript | Code Quality Tools | ESLint
    - Check enable and automatic search
1. Arrange imports automatically: 
    - Go to: Preferences | Editor | Code Style | JavaScript 
    - Checking Sort imports by modules on the Import tab. https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2018/05/optimize-imports-in-webstorm/
2. Use webpack for module resolves
    - Go to: Preferences | Languages & Frameworks | JavaScript | Webpack 
    - Chose the file `/webpack/client.dev.js`
3. Set some hotkeys
    - Go to: Preferences | Keymap
    - search for "Fix ESLint Problems" and assign a hotkey for easy reformatting. I use `cmd + alt + shift + e`.
4. After you have run `npm run dev` and `npm run prod` you will have to folders: _build_dev and _build_prod
    - Right click on them and click "Mark directory as" -> "Excluded"
5. Make sure you set REACT JSX as javascript version
    - Preferences | Languages & Frameworks | JavaScript
    
#### YOUR EDITOR SETUP
If you set up using another editor please document the process here.

## Guidelines
General principles:
1. Dont overengineer your components with if else statements, rather create two components.
2. It should be easy to know which code and redux-state is shared across many components/pages/containers.
3. Use themeStyle for all html elements which is specified in the design guidelines (Titles, BreadText, Buttons, etx..).
4. Make your code as pure as possible. `pure vs impure functions javascript`. 
    - The splice method (impure) changes the original array and slice (pure) method doesnâ€™t change the original array.
5. Use descriptive variable and function names, dont be afraid to use long names. Write a comment if you feel that the function requires a description.

### State
##### Redux Vs React
- Persistant state (which should survive browser back and forward navigation): Redux
- Global state (state between different pages): Redux
- Page specific state which should be cleaned on `componentDidUnmount`: React state 

##### Components
- Place single __shared__ components here. If it is not shared, place it as a child folder in the using container folder instead.
- Think of these components as the ones found here (component API) https://material-ui.com/api/button/
- Should preferably not be connected to redux.
##### Connectivity
- This is where you place network requests. For example api requests.
##### Containers
- A container of components and little jsx/html.
- Think of these components(containers) as a widget or a feature.
- They might or might not be connected to redux.
- The might contain child folders with components that are specific to that container.
##### Pages
- Place all the pages here.
- Make SSR network request through a redux action inside a static method called loadData
- Pages will contain components and/or containers and/or jsx
##### redux
- Place redux state here which is shared between many pages. For example:
    -  Users Data (authState, sessionState, userInfo, etc.)
    -  Request Data (hostname, countryCode, isMobile, etc) 
    -  App (scrollPosition, windowSize, networkProgress)
##### shared
- Place shared stuff like: images, util functions, fonts, styles, etc here.

### Redirects
- Guidlines
    - Prefer to do them in the component. 
    - https://coderwall.com/p/a5jeha/redux-separating-side-effects-from-actions-into-components
    - https://tylermcginnis.com/react-router-programmatically-navigate/
- If you for some reason cannot do them in the component you can import the global singleton history object `history.js`

### Immutable
- Always use immutable when possible (some npm libs might force you to use regular JS objects)
- Use the helper method `valIn()` when you expect that a value exists.
- Use the helper method `getIn()` when retrieving a value which you know might or might not exist.

### Design
#### Styleguide
- Always use theme-styles.scss for elements which are defined in the design guidlines (buttons, typography, layout)
- Use padding/margin TOP for spacing of elements and `&:first-child` to remove spacing of first item (if necessary).
    - Themed class `marginTop{size}` can be found in layout.scss 
#### fonts
- Fonts sizes are set in rem. "Unlike EM, REMs always refers back to what is set for the html tag". https://engageinteractive.co.uk/blog/em-vs-rem-vs-px
#### Globals
- Themed Sass Variables, Mixins and functions are globals (NO GLOBAL CLASSES!). It means that you dont have to import those files into using scss files. It builds with webpack.

## TESTING
Use Jest for testing.
- Check `immutableUtils.test.js` for examples on how to test util functions.
- Check `image.test.js` for example test on snapshopt test

## 3rd Party Libraries
Wrap 3rd party libs in wrapper components to prevent the system (webapp) to get too entangled by 3rd-party dependencies. 
It should be easy to replace 3rd party libraries with other similar libraries and by wrapping 3rd-party libraries in a
wrapper component we have created a visible easily controllable bridge for that library to interact with our system.
So to change a borrowed feature (like an npm lib), it should be possible to do so from a single source of entry, instead
of in many places in the code.
